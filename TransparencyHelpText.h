        "foreground colors. The foreground objects can appear semi-transparent, by <i>merging</i> the foreground color with the "
        "transparent background localed underneath. The amount by which these are merged is controlled by the <i>foreground intensity</i> option.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>shadow color</i> is the color used to possibly draw a shadow below some <i>foreground</i> objects (e.g. text). "
        "This option is ignored if the <i>shadow offset</i> variable (see below) is set to zero.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>background color</i> is the color possibly used on top of the transparent background. The amount of color used for the tint is controlled by "
        "the <i>tint intensity</i> option. The color is ignored if this intensity is set to zero. On the contrary if the intensity is set to its maximum "
        "value, the transparent background is ignored, which is effectively equivalent to disabling all transparency effects.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>shadow offset</i> is the offset between foreground objects (e.g. text) and the shadow that is drawn underneath. Setting this parameter to zero disables "
        "the drawing of any shadow</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>foreground intensity</i> controls the amount of merging between the foreground color and the transparent background located "
        "underneath. A value of zero makes all foreground objects invisible. On the contrary a maximum value corresponds to a <i>solid</i> foreground "
        "color, meaning that the background below is not visible.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>tint intensity</i> is the amount of tint color merged to the transparent background to form the application background. "
