        "These options can be modified in the <i>Transparency</i> panel of the configuration dialog</p>"
        "<p>The following options are available:</p>"
        "<ul>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>use transparency</i> is used to enable/disable transparency globally.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>use compositing</i> is used to enable/disable <i>true</i> transparency, when available (depending on the underlying operating system), "
        "provided that the <i>transparency</i> flag is used. When disabled, (or when compositing is not available), an attempt is made "
        "to use <i>fake</i> transparency, which consists of retrieving the desktop background picture, and merging it with the application "
        "<i>foreground</i> when drawing it on screen. The ability to retrieve the desktop background picture is also operating system dependent.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>foreground color</i> is the default color used to display the application <i>foreground</i> objects (e.g. text). "
        "Some applications that have more complex objects to display use additional settings to allow for using multiple "
        "foreground colors. The foreground objects can appear semi-transparent, by <i>merging</i> the foreground color with the "
        "transparent background localed underneath. The amount by which these are merged is controlled by the <i>foreground intensity</i> option.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>shadow color</i> is the color used to possibly draw a shadow below some <i>foreground</i> objects (e.g. text). "
        "This option is ignored if the <i>shadow offset</i> variable (see below) is set to zero.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>tint color</i> is the color possibly used on top of the transparent background. The amount of color used for the tint is controlled by "
        "the <i>tint intensity</i> option. The color is ignored if this intensity is set to zero. On the contrary if the intensity is set to its maximum "
        "value, the transparent background is ignored, which is effectively equivalent to disabling all transparency effects.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>highlight color</i> is the color possibly used on top of the transparent background, to highlight the application when the mouse pointer "
        "points to it. It behaves similarly to the tint color and the amount of highlighting is controlled by the <i>highlight intensity</i> option.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>shadow offset</i> is the offset between foreground objects (e.g. text) and the shadow that is drawn underneath. Setting this parameter to zero disables "
        "the drawing of any shadow</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>foreground intensity</i> controls the amount of merging between the foreground color and the transparent background located "
        "underneath. A value of zero makes all foreground objects invisible. On the contrary a maximum value corresponds to a <i>solid</i> foreground "
        "color, meaning that the background below is not visible.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>tint intensity</i> is the amount of tint color merged to the transparent background to form the application background. "
        "A value of zero correspond to no tint. A maximum value effectively disable transparency effects.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>highlight intensity</i> is similar to the <i>tint intensity</i> option, excepts that it is used only when the application "
        "is pointed to by the mouse pointer.</li>"
        "<li style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'><i>opacity</i> controls the overall opacity of the application. This flag allows to set a <i>global</i> true opacity value for all objects constituting "
        "the application, disregarding all settings above. It is less general than the <use compositing</i> flag above, but works on a broader range "
        "of operating systems.</li>"
