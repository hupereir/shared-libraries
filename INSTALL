How to install textool
-----------------------

Get a tarball of latest release and unpack:
gtar -xzvf textool-X.X.tar.gz or
tar -xzvf textool-X.X.tar.gz

I. autogen.sh:
-------------

cd textool-X.X/
./autogen.sh

(see below or use ./autogen.sh --help for options)

II. Make:
---------

make install

to install the code. This will install textool in the default installation path of your system (e.g. /usr/local/bin, or /usr/bin, depending on the system).
This usually requires root privileges at the installation stage. Alternatively a different installation path can be set at configuration
time using the --prefix autogen option.

III. Local installation:
------------------------

For a local installation use:
./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME

Binaries and resource files will be created in $HOME/bin and
$HOME/share/textool, respectively.


IV. Troubles at configuration:
------------------------------

autogen.sh may possibly complained of not finding the Qt libraries libraries and/or
headers. The default path is assumed to be:

/usr/lib/qt4/lib for libraries
/usr/lib/qt4/include for headers
/usr/lib/qt4/bin for binaries (namely moc, the Qt meta object file generator)

You can tell autogen.sh where to find non default path:

./autogen.sh --with-Qt=[path]

in which case [path]/lib, [path]/include and [path]/bin will be use in place of
the defaults.

You can also explicitely define all path:
using:
./autogen.sh \
  --with-Qt-lib=[lib_path] \
  --with-Qt-include=[include_path] \
  --with-Qt-bin=[bin_path]

Make sure you have all libraries, header for Qt installed on your platform.

Other plugins are needed to run all textool utilities. They do not make the
configuration nor the compilation crash. The corresponding tools are however
disabled.

- A text editor: default is nedit
- LaTex: default is latex
- dvi to postscript file convertor: default is dvips
- postscript to pdf file convertor: default is ps2pdf
- a dvi file viewer: default is xdvi
- a postscript file viewer: default is gv
- a pdf file viewer: default is xpdf
- a spell checker: default is SpellCheck

Alternate applications can be specified in the resource file.
